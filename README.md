# Countdown-BrainF
Brainfuck code for countdown.  

Program Objective:
Prompt the user to enter a single digit (e.g., '7').
Convert that ASCII character (like '7', which is ASCII code 55) into its actual numerical value (the number 7).
Then, print out the sequence of digits counting down to 0 (e.g., if they entered '7', it would print "76543210").
